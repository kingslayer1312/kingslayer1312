### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hrishikesh, presently a sophomore pursuing a degree in Computer Science  
As far as my hobbies are concerned, I enjoy coding. I'm also an avid reader and above all, I enjoy *creating* - be it software or stories to tell.  

I enjoy Android development - I primarily use Kotlin (Jetpack Compose) or Flutter.    
Presently, I am exploring backend development using SpringBoot.  
I have some research experience in my undergrad in machine learning, exploring areas such as image classification and knowledge distillation.
