### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hrishikesh, presently a sophomore pursuing a degree in Computer Science  
As far as my hobbies are concerned, I enjoy coding. I'm also an avid reader and above all, I enjoy *creating* - be it software or stories to tell.  

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Android development in Kotlin (Jetpack Compose) and Flutter.  
ðŸ“š I am comfortable with Python, C and C++. In addition, I also know a bit of R.  
ðŸ¤“ I wish to begin learning web development
